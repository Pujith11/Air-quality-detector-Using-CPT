In this project, I propose an air quality detection and monitoring system using Cisco Packet Tracer. The system utilizes smart IoT devices, including window and door sensors and carbon monoxide detectors, to ensure a safe and healthy indoor environment. These devices communicate with a home gateway, which connects to a smartphone application for remote monitoring and control. By providing real-time data on air quality, temperature, humidity, and carbon monoxide levels, the system enhances air quality management in homes and buildings.

The proposed system addresses the growing concerns surrounding air pollution and its impact on human health. By offering a user-friendly, integrated solution for air quality monitoring, the system empowers users to manage their indoor environment effectively. Its ability to provide actionable insights through a smartphone app can significantly improve safety and quality of life for individuals and communities.
